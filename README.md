# Fireside

A mobile-first React application created in order to bridge the gap between intergenerational friendships. This app was created as part of the November 2021 Holiday Accessibility Hackathon at General Assembly.

ü•á Fireside won First Place and üéóÔ∏è People's Choice awards during this juried hackathon.

Our objective with this app was to bring together various generations, who are randomly matched with the 'opposite' age group, in order to help one another. Baby boomers and beyond can get help from the younger generation for whatever they require,including but not limited to platonic companionship, gift ideas and so on.  In return, the younger generation can recieve life advice, the knowledge they've done a good deed, while also fufilling their need for companionship. 

## The Tech

This was built out using React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, and SASS.

We chose to use React instead of React Native for this application due to the (less than) 3-day time constraint of the hackathon, but future iterations of this app are intended to be built using React Native in order to increase cross-platform availability and compatibility.

## Set up

If you want to check out the demo, please follow the link in the description. If you'd like to check out the code or run it locally, you need to have Node installed. Once downloaded, run:
    npm install
This will install the necessary dependencies. Then run:
